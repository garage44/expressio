# Current Project Context

**Last Updated**: Generation 1 (ALE setup complete)
**Project**: Expressio Translation Service

## Project Architecture

### Monorepo Structure
- `packages/expressio/` - Main translation service application
- `packages/common/` - Shared components and utilities
- `packages/enola/` - Translation engine (Anthropic, DeepL)
- `packages/bunchy/` - Build/task management

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Preact + SCSS + WebSockets
- **Backend**: Bun runtime + WebSocket server
- **Translation**: Anthropic/DeepL integration
- **Build**: Bun for compilation and serving

## Current Development Focus

### Completed
- Basic project structure established
- Package separation defined
- CSS token system initialized
- WebSocket architecture planned
- **ALE Framework**: Implemented continuous learning system with file-based knowledge persistence

### In Progress
- Frontend component implementation
- Translation interface design
- Real-time update system

### Next Objectives
- Complete translation UI components
- Implement WebSocket real-time updates
- Integrate translation engines
- Add workspace management

## ALE System Status

### Framework Active
- ✅ Continuous learning from all interactions
- ✅ File-based knowledge persistence established
- ✅ User preferences documented and accumulating
- ✅ Effective strategies being captured
- ✅ Institutional memory building

### Knowledge Base
- `patterns/user-preferences.md` - Communication and coding style patterns
- `patterns/effective-strategies.md` - Proven approaches and solutions
- `patterns/failure-patterns.md` - Anti-patterns to avoid
- `active/current-context.md` - This file, project state tracking

## User Preferences (Key Points)
- Prefers practical implementation over theoretical discussion
- Values continuous learning from ALL interactions (not just complex ones)
- Wants file-based knowledge persistence for institutional memory
- Prefers semantic CSS naming and minimal variable systems
- Uses TypeScript/Preact stack with monorepo architecture
- Appreciates direct, actionable responses with concrete examples

## Development Approach
- Build upon existing patterns rather than creating new ones
- Check established components/tokens before adding new ones
- Focus on clean, maintainable code structure
- Use evolutionary improvements over revolutionary changes
