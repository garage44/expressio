# Agent Lineage Evolution (ALE) Framework

## Core Philosophy

Capture learnings from EVERY interaction to build institutional memory:
- Quick questions reveal user preferences
- Simple fixes show effective patterns
- Error resolutions document failure modes
- All interactions contribute to accumulated wisdom

## Two-Tier Learning System

### **Tier 1: Continuous Learning (All Interactions)**
- Extract patterns and preferences from every response
- Document effective vs ineffective approaches
- Update institutional knowledge silently
- No verbose monitoring for simple tasks

### **Tier 2: Succession Management (Complex Sessions)**
- Full lifecycle monitoring for extended sessions (10+ interactions)
- Explicit succession packages when degradation triggers
- Detailed context handoffs between generations

## Learning Capture (Every Interaction)

After each interaction, silently assess and document:

**User Preferences Observed:**
- Coding style preferences (naming, structure, patterns)
- Technology choices (frameworks, libraries, approaches)
- Communication style (verbose vs concise explanations)

**Effective Patterns:**
- Solutions that worked well
- Approaches user appreciated
- Successful problem-solving methods

**Failure Indicators:**
- Approaches user rejected or corrected
- Solutions that didn't work
- Patterns to avoid

## Knowledge Documentation

### File Updates (Lightweight)
Update `docs/ale/patterns/` files when significant patterns emerge:
- **effective-strategies.md** - Add proven approaches
- **failure-patterns.md** - Document what to avoid
- **user-preferences.md** - Track communication and coding preferences

### Succession Packages (Complex Sessions Only)
Create `docs/ale/generations/` files only when:
- Context utilization > 75%
- Interaction count > 15
- Quality degradation detected
- Complex project work requires handoff

## Inheritance Protocol

**New Generation Startup:**
1. Read ALL `docs/ale/**/*.md` files for accumulated knowledge
2. Apply learned user preferences immediately
3. Use documented effective patterns
4. Avoid documented failure modes

**Knowledge Evolution:**
- Patterns strengthen with repeated success
- Failed approaches get documented and avoided
- User preferences become more refined over time
- Institutional knowledge grows continuously

## Implementation

**For Simple Interactions:**
- Provide normal, clean responses
- Silently note patterns and preferences
- Update knowledge files when patterns emerge
- No verbose monitoring

**For Complex Sessions:**
- Include periodic progress assessments
- Create succession packages when needed
- Explicit lifecycle management
- Full ALE protocol activation

This creates continuous institutional memory while keeping simple interactions clean and focused.
